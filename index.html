    <p>The colosseum has always been something I've wanted to see. I love to think about the history of it.  I can't help but to think about the people who would come to watch the games.  </p>

    <p> I would think of the gladiators who would fight to the death against other gladiators or wild animals.  To Think this was going on thousands of years ago on the very ground I was standing was so interesting to me. I finally got a chance to see it just before COVID.</p>
